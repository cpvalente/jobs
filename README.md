# Jobs

The goal here is to create a proper **"Job Board"** that pairs open-source contributors with projects that need designers.
It will be a mix of _both gratis as well as paid work._
A job can range from a small task to an entire project.
I think the ideal balance would be a mix of about:

- 25% small singular tasks
- 15% new or fork of an existing project
- 60% product/feature development on existing projects

_Note: this process is rough and a work in progress, please feel free to contribute your ideas, approaches, and of course jobs :)_

## Submit a Job

Our job submission process is done **"in the open"** so if you work on an open-source software project or community, feel free to submit a job to our Job Board. Just do the following:

**Easy Web Form**

1. Go to [our form](https://opensourcedesign.net/jobs/job-form/) and fill in the details.
2. Submit the form.
3. Wait for us to approve your job posting.
4. Have a margarita or a hot chocolate.

**Using Terminal (for nerds)**

1. Fork the `jobs` repo
2. Copy `job-template.md` into the `jobs` folder and change the name
3. Name your copy something like `2015-03-12-sticker-design-for-fun.md` starting with the date
4. Make sure there is a `.md` extension to the file you copied or it won't work
5. Fill out the fields inside the template you just copied
   - Possibly try running `jekyll` to make sure your posting looks right.
6. Submit a pull request
7. Have a margarita or hot chocolate

After those steps you will have submitted a job to the OSD job board, you rule ;)

## Fields values

**Status**: Accepted values for job status are `searching` and `closed` and 'solved'.

Note to job posters: Once your job has been completed/filled please go to [your job in this repos folder](https://github.com/opensourcedesign/jobs/tree/master/jobs) and change the status from 'searching' to either 'closed' or 'solved'. We'd also appreciate it if you could [complete our survey](https://cloud.opensourcedesign.net/apps/forms/DNTkJM32eWd9EQjn) to make jobs on open-source design better :)
