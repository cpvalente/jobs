ImagePro is an open-source Figma plugin designed to enhance image editing capabilities within Figma. We are seeking a passionate UI/UX enthusiast to provide guidance and support for our plugin. The plugin currently has some great features, but we plan to add many more in the future. If you love contributing to open-source projects and have a knack for UI/UX design, we'd love to collaborate with you! Feel free to reach out or share this opportunity with anyone who might be interested. Thank you!
