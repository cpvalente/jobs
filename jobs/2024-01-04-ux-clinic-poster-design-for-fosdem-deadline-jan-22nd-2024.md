Open Source Design runs design clinics at various conferences and we’d like to make sure we can decorate our stand and our helpers for the clinic! things we’ll need:

Posters designed by community members - A5, A4 or A3 paper size - a file format (.pdf .jpg .png)

Name tags with a blank space for a persons name and pronouns to be written - 8cm high x 10cm width

Sign up sheet for a OSS project to put their project name, details, needs and a time slot - A4 size

Fake doctor magazine covers about design and ux - A4/magazine cover size

Fake medicine boxes but it’s to do with UX and design

anything else you think would be fun for the UX clinic!
