Brother Promise (Phap The) of Plum Village has developed the Daily Wellness Empowerment Program (DWEP). The participants use paper to record their progress, and we now want to create an app as a replacement for the tracking (and adding some other features)

The DWEP has 10 different practices, and we'd like to have SVG icons/graphics for each of these, possibly with a short animation of the SVG when pressing "done" for the practice

Also we'd like to have SVG files for the three states that each practice can be in: Done, Not done, Undetermined

(In the current prototype we just use unicode characters: https://tord.codeberg.page/dwep/ )
